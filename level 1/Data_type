A program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

age = input("What is your current age?")
age_r=int(age)
year=90-age_r
day_r=year*365
week_r=year*52
month_r=year*12
message=f"You have {day_r} days, {week_r} weeks, and {month_r} months left."
print(message)
